### Introduction
My name is Scarlett Wong (王慧宇); I am a new grad who is current seeking a full-time gameplay programmer or technical game designer job. I have solid computer science and game design 
& development background. I’ve also built multiple different games on Unity 2D, including **survival horror & adventure** puzzle, **PC fighting**, and **apple catching games** with two 
different features of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA).
