----
### Introduction
My name is Scarlett Wong (王慧宇). I am a new grad who is current seeking a full-time gameplay programmer or technical game designer job. On August 19th 2018, I'd received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science at University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ). On May 7th 2021, I'd received a Master of Science degree in Game Science & Design at Northeastern University (Boston, MA). 

I have solid computer science and game design & development background. I’ve also built multiple different games on **Unity 2D**, including **survival horror & adventure** puzzle, **PC fighting**, and **apple catching games** with two different features of **dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA)**. Meanwhile, I am able to establish the 3D game world in the Unity engine. In the previous solo or group game projects, I was used to be a **game designer**, **2D pixel game artist**, **gameplay programmer**, and **Indie Game Developer**. At the same time, I am able to study games' **mechanics**, **stories**, **aesthetics**, **technologies** and **players' cognitive psychologies** in multiple dimensions by using qualitative and quantitative research methods, then use **R** to analyze the game data by creating various data visualization methods. Currently, I am learning the Unity 3D game development on **Udemy.com**.

In a team of game development, I am a **quick learner**, an **efficient problem solver**, and a **patient coordinator**. With the **10-year** study abroad appearences, both of my verbal and written english are good, and I am capable of reading various English computer science related dissertations. 

As a gamer and anime fans, I am a player of both achiever and explorer; my favorite games genres are open-world, action-adventure, and RPG: especially *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *The Elder Scroll V: Skyrim*. I extremely prefer creating games to only playing games. In my prospective career goal, I would like to devote myself to creating the video games with different game genres, bringing plenty of pleasures to different types of players.
