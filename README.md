### Introduction
My name is Huiyu Wang (王慧宇, 英文名: Scarlett Wong). I am a new grad who is currently seeking a full-time gameplay programmer or technical game designer job. 

On August 19th, 2018, I’d received a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (minor: Mathematics) at University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ). During the 4-year undergraduate periods, I’ve studied the following courses:

1.	CSC 127A. Introduction to Computer Science I
2.	CSC 127B. Introduction to Computer Science II
3.	CSC 252. Computer Organization
4.	CSC 335. Object-Oriented Programming and Design
5.	CSC 337. Web Programming
6.	CSC 345. Analysis of Discrete Structures
7.	CSC 352. Systems Programming and Unix
8.	CSC 444. Data Visualization
9.	CSC 460. Database Systems
10.	Math 122A. Functions for Calculus
11.	Math 122B. First Semester Calculus
12.	Math 129. Calculus II
13.	Math 223. Vector Calculus
14.	Math 243. Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science
15.	Math 313. Linear Algebra
16.	Math 323. Formal Mathematical Reasoning and Writing

On May 7th, 2021, I’d received a Master of Science in Game Science & Design at Northeastern University (Boston, MA). During the 2-year graduate periods, I’ve studied the following courses:

1.	GSND 5110. Game Design and Analysis
2.	GSND 5111. Seminar for GSND 5110
3.	GSND 5122. Business Models in the Game Industry
4.	GSND 5130. Mixed Research Methods for Games
5.	GSND 6250. Spatial and Temporal Design
6.	GSND 6320. Psychology of Play
7.	GSND 6330. Player Experience
8.	GSND 7990. Thesis
9.	ARTG 5330. Visualization Technologies 1: Fundamentals
10.	ARTG 5640. Prototyping for Experience Design

I have solid computer science (especially object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithm analysis) and game design & development academic background. The two OOP languages which I am best at are **Java** and **C#**, and my frequently-used game engine is **Unity**; I’ve also built multiple different games on **Unity 2D**, including **survival horror & adventure** puzzle, **PC fighting**, and **apple catching games** with two different features of **dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA)**; in addition, I can build the 3D game world in Unity 3D. In the previous solo or group game projects, I was used to be a **game designer**, **2D pixel game artist**, **gameplay programmer**, and **Indie Game Developer**. Meanwhile, I am able to study games' **mechanics**, **stories**, **aesthetics**, **technologies** and **players' cognitive psychologies** in multiple dimensions by using qualitative and quantitative research methods, then use **R** to analyze the game data by creating various data visualization methods. Currently, I am learning the Unity 3D game development on **Udemy.com**.

In a team of game development, I am a **quick learner**, an **efficient problem solver**, and a **patient coordinator**. With the **10-year** study abroad experiences, both of my verbal and written English are good, and I am capable of reading various English computer science related dissertations. 

As a gamer and animation fans, I am a player of both achiever and explorer; my favorite games genres are action-adventure, and RPG: especially *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *The Elder Scroll V: Skyrim*. I extremely prefer creating games to only playing games. In my prospective career goal, I would like to devote myself to creating the video games with different genres, bringing plenty of pleasures to different types of players.
